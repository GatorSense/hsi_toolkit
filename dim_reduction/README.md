# Gatorsense hsitoolkit dimenstionality reduction methods MATLAB version
hsitoolkit/dim_reduction

Demo instructions:

(1) load an_hsi_image_sub_for_demo.mat

(2) run `im_reduced = dim_reduction_demo(hsi_img_sub, wavelengths)`


Suite of dimensionality reduction methods implemented so far:
-MNF: maximum noise fraction
-hierarchicalDimensionalityReuction: Dimensionality reduction by averaging wavelengths with similar distribution of pixel values based on KL-divergence and hierarchical clustering
